MySQL is an open source DBMS which is built, supported and distributed by MySQL AB (now acquired by Oracle)

The default port for MySQL Server is 3306. Another standard default is port 1433 in TCP/IP for SQL Server.

DDL->Data Definition Language CREATE TABLE 
DML->Data Manipulation Language SELECT, INSERT 
DCL->Data Control Language GRANT, REVOKE

In MySQL the Joins are used to query data from two or more tables.

Inner Join returns the rows if there is at least one match in both the tables. 
Left Join returns all the rows form the left table even if there is no match in the right table. 
Right Join returns all the rows from the right table even if no matches exist in left table. 
Full Join would return rows when there is at least one match in the tables.

CHAR is used to define the fixed length of the table and columns. The length value could be in the range of 1-255. 
VARCHAR command is given to adjust the column and table length as required.

Basically HEAP tables are in-memory and used for high speed temporary storages. 
But TEXT or BLOB fields are not allowed within them. They also do not support AUTO INCREMENT.

Different types of strings that can be used for database columns are SET, BLOB, VARCHAR, TEX, ENUM, and CHAR.

The syntax for getting the current version of MySQL is SELECT VERSION ();

Types of Tables in MySQL:
HEAP is the table that is used for fast data access but data will be lost if the table or system crashes. 
InoDB is the table that supports transactions using the COMMIT and ROLL BACK commands.
BDB can support transactions similar to InoDB but the execution is slower.

The following TRIGGERS are allowed in MySQL:
BEFORE INSERT
AFTER INSERT
BEFORE UPDATE
AFTER UPDATE
BEFORE DELETE
AFTER DELETE 

How can we change the root password if the root password is lost?
In such cases when the password is lost the user should start the DB with – skip-grants-table and then change the password. Thereafter with the new password the user should restart the DB in normal mode.

Basically DELETE TABLE is logged operation and every row deleted is logged. 
Therefore the process is usually slow. TRUNCATE TABLE also deletes rows in a table but it will not log any of the rows deleted.  
The process is faster in comparison. TRUNCATE TABLE can be rolled back and is functionally similar to the DELETE statement using no WHERE clause.

While both are used to enforce uniqueness of the column defined but primary key would create a clustered index whereas unique key would create non-clustered index on the column. 
Primary key does not allow ‘NULL’ but unique key allows it. 

How can one restart SQL Server in single user or minimal configuration modes?
The command line SQLSERVER.EXE used with –m will restart SQL Server in single user mode and with –f will start it in minimal configuration mode.

BLOBs are binary large object holding huge data. 4 types of BLOB are TINYBLOB, BLOB, MEDIBLOB, and LONGBLOB. TEXT is case-sensitive BLOB. 4 types of TEXT are TINY TEXT, TEXT, MEDIUMTEXT, and LONG TEXT.


What is the basic MySQL architecture?
The logical architecture of MySQL is made of ‘connection manager’, ‘query optimizer’, and ‘pluggable engines’.


Following are differences for FLOAT and DOUBLE:
• Floating point numbers are stored in FLOAT with eight place accuracy and it has four bytes.
• Floating point numbers are stored in DOUBLE with accuracy of 18 places and it has eight bytes.

What is the difference between primary key and candidate key?
Every row of a table is identified uniquely by primary key. There is only one primary key for a table.
Primary Key is also a candidate key. By common convention, candidate key can be designated as primary and which can be used for any foreign key references.

What do you mean by % and _ in the LIKE statement?
% corresponds to 0 or more characters, _ is exactly one character in the LIKE statement.

Why do we use MySQL?
MySQL database server is dependable, fast and user-friendly. One can download the software from the internet and as freeware.
