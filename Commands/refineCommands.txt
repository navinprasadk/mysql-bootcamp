DISTINCT: -> displays unique data
Example:
SELECT DISTINCT author_lname FROM books;
SELECT DISTINCT author_fname, author_lname FROM books;




ORDER BY -> sorting
	 -> ASCENDING by default
Example:
SELECT author_lname FROM books ORDER BY author_lname;
SELECT author_lname FROM books ORDER BY author_lname DESC;
SELECT title, author_fname, author_lname 
FROM books ORDER BY 2;
SELECT author_fname, author_lname FROM books 
ORDER BY author_lname, author_fname;




LIMIT -> how many results we want to display
Example:
SELECT title FROM books LIMIT 3;
SELECT title, released_year FROM books ORDER BY released_year DESC LIMIT 5;
SELECT title, released_year FROM books ORDER BY released_year DESC LIMIT 0,3;
SELECT title, released_year FROM books ORDER BY released_year DESC LIMIT 1,3;
SELECT title, released_year FROM books ORDER BY released_year DESC LIMIT 10,1;
SELECT * FROM tbl LIMIT 95,18446744073709551615;
 



LIKE -> Searching (pattern matcing)
Example:
SELECT title, author_fname FROM books WHERE author_fname LIKE '%da%'; // search the author_fname which contains da
SELECT title, author_fname FROM books WHERE author_fname LIKE 'da%'; // search the author_fname which starts with da___
SELECT title FROM books WHERE  title LIKE 'the'; // search the word 'the'
SELECT title, stock_quantity FROM books WHERE stock_quantity LIKE '__'; // it returns the list of stock_quantity which has 2 character counts
SELECT title FROM books WHERE title LIKE '%\%%';
SELECT title FROM books WHERE title LIKE '%\_%';
