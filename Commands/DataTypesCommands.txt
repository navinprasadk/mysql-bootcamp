char and varchar?
char is faster for fixed length

What's a good use case for CHAR?
------
Used for text that we know has a fixed length, e.g., State abbreviations, 
abbreviated company names, sex M/F, etc.

decimal data type is a fixed point type and calculations are exact,
In mysql the decimal type has several synonyms: numeric, dec, fixed

Int-> whole numbers
Decimal-> 
 DECIMAL(5,2);
	5 digits long 2 digits after decimal point
	Totally 5 digits
 
 Example:
	CREATE TABLE items(price DECIMAL(5,2));
 
	INSERT INTO items(price) VALUES(7);
 	o/p:7
	INSERT INTO items(price) VALUES(7987654);
 	o/p:999:99 (this is the max value)

Decimals are exact, float/double are approximate


Float and Double: -> calculations are approimate, store large number using less space

Float 4bytes
Double 8bytes


Dates and Times:
Date -> format -> 'yyyy-mm-dd'
Time -> format -> 'hh:mm:ss'
DATETIME -> format -> 'yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss'

Example:
CREATE TABLE people (name VARCHAR(100), birthdate DATE, birthtime TIME, birthdt DATETIME);
 
INSERT INTO people (name, birthdate, birthtime, birthdt)
VALUES('Padma', '1983-11-11', '10:07:35', '1983-11-11 10:07:35');
INSERT INTO people (name, birthdate, birthtime, birthdt)
VALUES('Larry', '1943-12-25', '04:10:42', '1943-12-25 04:10:42');



What's the difference between DATETIME and TIMESTAMP?
------
They both store datetime information, but there's a difference in the range, 
TIMESTAMP has a smaller range. TIMESTAMP also takes up less space. 
TIMESTAMP is used for things like meta-data about when something is created
or updated.
 



CURDATE() -> gives current date, 
CURTIME() -> gives current time, 
NOW() -> gives current date time


SELECT name, birthdt, MONTH(birthdt) FROM people;
SELECT name, birthdt, MONTHNAME(birthdt) FROM people;
SELECT name, birthtime, HOUR(birthtime) FROM people; 
SELECT name, birthtime, MINUTE(birthtime) FROM people;
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(birthdt, '%m/%d/%Y') FROM people;
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(birthdt, '%m/%d/%Y at %h:%i') FROM people;


DATEMATH:
DATEDIFF and DATEADD

SELECT DATEDIFF(NOW(), birthdate) FROM people;
SELECT name, birthdate, DATEDIFF(NOW(), birthdate) FROM people;
SELECT birthdt FROM people;
SELECT birthdt, DATE_ADD(birthdt, INTERVAL 1 MONTH) FROM people;
SELECT birthdt, DATE_ADD(birthdt, INTERVAL 10 SECOND) FROM people;
SELECT birthdt, DATE_ADD(birthdt, INTERVAL 3 QUARTER) FROM people;
SELECT birthdt, birthdt + INTERVAL 1 MONTH FROM people;
SELECT birthdt, birthdt - INTERVAL 5 MONTH FROM people;
SELECT birthdt, birthdt + INTERVAL 15 MONTH + INTERVAL 10 HOUR FROM people;


TIMESTAMP
DATETIME -> 1000-01-01 00:00:00 to 9999-12-31 23:59:59
	 -> twicely large space than timestamp
TIMESTAMP -> 1970-0-01:00:00:01 UTC to 2038-01-19 03:14:07 UTC
	  -> used for adding metadata. Like when it is created or updated		

CREATE TABLE comments (
    content VARCHAR(100),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE comments2 (
    content VARCHAR(100),
    changed_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW() ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

 
CREATE TABLE comments2 (
    content VARCHAR(100),
    changed_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW() ON UPDATE NOW()
);
