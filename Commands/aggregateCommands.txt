Count:
Example:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM books;
SELECT COUNT(distinct author_fname, author_lname) from books;


Group by-> summarizes or aggregates identical data into single rows
Example:
SELECT title, author_fname, author_lname FROM books GROUP BY author_lname;
SELECT author_fname, author_lname, COUNT(*) FROM books GROUP BY author_lname, author_fname;



Min and Max:
Example:
SELECT MAX(released_year) 
FROM books;
SELECT MAX(pages), title
FROM books;


Problem with min and max:

SELECT title, pages FROM books 
WHERE pages = (SELECT Min(pages) 
                FROM books); 
 
SELECT * FROM books 
ORDER BY pages ASC LIMIT 1;



Min and Max Group By

SELECT
  author_fname,
  author_lname,
  Max(pages)
FROM books
GROUP BY author_lname,
         author_fname;

Or

SELECT
  CONCAT(author_fname, ' ', author_lname) AS author,
  MAX(pages) AS 'longest book'
FROM books
GROUP BY author_lname,
         author_fname; 




Sum:
SELECT SUM(pages)
FROM books;

SELECT author_fname,
       author_lname,
       Sum(pages)
FROM books
GROUP BY
    author_lname,
    author_fname;


Avg:
SELECT AVG(pages) 
FROM books;


SELECT AVG(stock_quantity) 
FROM books 
GROUP BY released_year;

SELECT author_fname, author_lname, AVG(pages) FROM books
GROUP BY author_lname, author_fname;
